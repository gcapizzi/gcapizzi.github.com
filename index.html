    <section id="profile">
      <p>I'm a software engineer focused on sustainable software development:
        growing high-quality, mantainable, well-tested software is what I do
        best. I have a solid grasp of object-oriented design principles and
        test-driven development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.</p>
      <p>I have a strong knowledge of Ruby and Rails, but I'm a polyglot by
        nature: during the years I've played with PHP, Python, Java and
        JavaScript, either for work or for fun. Lately I've been focusing on
        learning functional programming, writing a lot of Clojure and Haskell
        code.</p>
      <p>I'm an active member of different communities: the <a
          class="printable" href="http://bglug.it">Bergamo Linux User
          Group</a>, which I joined in 2006, <a class="printable"
          href="http://codelovers.it">CodeLovers</a>, a developers meetup I've
        helped setting up, and the <a class="printable"
          href="http://milano-xpug.pbworks.com">Milan XP User Group</a>. I had
        the chance to participate as a speaker at each of them.</p>

          making process, which collects data from different sources,
