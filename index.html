      <p>
        I'm a software engineer focused on sustainable software development: growing high-quality, mantainable,
        well-tested software is what I do best. I have a solid grasp of object-oriented design principles and
        test-driven development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a strong knowledge of Ruby and Rails, but I'm a polyglot by nature: during the years I've played with
        PHP, Python, Java and JavaScript, either for work or for fun. Lately I've been focusing on learning functional
        programming, writing a lot of Clojure and Haskell code.

          a global mobile payment platform with over 5 billion users in 70 countries, where I was in charge of
          developing and mantaining one of the crucial components of their service-oriented architecture, built on PHP
          and MongoDB. I also developed a specialized Rails-based CMS which allows to quickly build digital content
          selling websites that use Onebip as their payment provider.
