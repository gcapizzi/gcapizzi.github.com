      <h1 id="name">Giuseppe Capizzi</h1>

      <p>I'm a software engineer focused on sustainable software development:
        growing high-quality, mantainable, well-tested software is what I do
        best. I have a solid grasp of object-oriented design principles and
        test-driven development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.</p>
      <p>I'm particulary good with Ruby and Rails, but I'm a polyglot by
        nature: during the years I've played with PHP, Python, Java and
        JavaScript, either for work or for fun. Lately I've been doing my best
        to learn functional programming, writing a lot of Clojure and Haskell
        code.</p>
      <p>Like every good craftsman, I care a lot about the tools I use: my
        current setup consists of Unix (either Linux or Mac OS X), Vim, Zsh,
        Tmux, and Git.</p>
      <p>I'm an active member of different communities: the <a
          class="printable" href="http://bglug.it">Bergamo Linux User
          Group</a>, which I joined in 2006, <a class="printable"
          href="http://codelovers.it">CodeLovers</a>, a developers meetup I've
        helped organizing, and the <a class="printable"
          href="http://milano-xpug.pbworks.com">Milano XP User Group</a>. I had
        the chance to speak at each of those meetings.</p>

          <p>I'm currently employed at <strong><a class="printable"
                href="http://xpeppers.com">XPeppers</a></strong>, a software
            consultancy focused on agile methodologies and extreme

            mobile payment platform with over 5 billion users in 70 countries.
            I'm in charge of developing and mantaining one of the crucial
            components of their service-oriented architecture, built on PHP and
            MongoDB. I've also developed a specialized Rails-based CMS which

            databases, Google Analytics and reports from insurance companies to
            supply the business with the insights they need. I've also worked
            on the mobile versions of the mortgages and loans comparators.</p>
