        I'm a software engineer focused on sustainable software development: growing high quality, maintainable,
        well tested software is what I do best. I have a solid grasp of software design principles and test driven
        development is an invaluable tool in my daily practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I've spent the last 3 years writing mostly Go, I'm a polyglot by nature: I've coded professionally in
        Java, Ruby, Python and PHP. I'm always interested in learning new things and I try to dedicate some time to
        studying every day. Lately I've been focusing on functional programming with Haskell, programming languages
        theory and systems programming with Rust.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience in consulting has taught me what high performing, agile teams look like and how to be an effective
        coach and mentor. I've worked with enterprise teams to upskill them, to improve their development processes, and
        to recruit new team members. As a member of the <a class="printable" href="https://codebar.io">Codebar</a>
        community, I've spent hundreds of hours coaching people from underrepresented backgrounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have spent the last 3 years working on <a class="printable" href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org">Cloud
          Foundry</a>, an open source platform as a service, and learning a lot about the cloud native ecosystem in the
        process. As one of the maintainers of the containers runtime for CF, I'm exposed daily to the Linux programming
        interface and its containerisation primitives in particular.

        <h3>Pivotal</h3>
        <span class="subtitle">Software Engineer â¬© London, United Kingdom â¬© March 2015â€“current</span>
        <p>
          <a class="printable" href="https://pivotal.io">Pivotal</a>, now part of <a class="printable"
            href="https://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>, helps enterprises to transform the way they build software to be
          more lean and agile. To do this, they offer both a renowned agile consultancy service, <i>Pivotal Labs</i>,
          and a multi-cloud platform as a service, <i>Pivotal Platform</i>, based on Cloud Foundry. I have had the
          opportunity to work on both.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <strong>Pivotal Labs</strong> engineer, I helped both startups and big enterprises to build digital
          products using a lean and agile process, from the inception to the deployment in production. All our teams
          included product managers, designers and engineers, and all our projects started with a phase of discovery
          and research. On the engineering side, we practiced extreme programming, focusing on pair programming,
          test-driven development and continuous integration. I was a tech lead in two occasions, on teams of 4 and 8
          people respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on <strong>Pivotal Platform</strong>, Pivotal's distribution of the Cloud Foundry
          platform as a service. I've contributed to <a class=printable"
            href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore">BOSH Backup and Restore</a>, a
          backup and restore tool for <a class="printable" href="https://bosh.io">BOSH</a> deployments, and <a 
            class="printable" href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/garden-runc-release">Garden</a>, the Cloud Foundry
          container runtime. Recently I've been focusing on refactoring the codebase to ease the transition from the
          old backend based on <a class="printable" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc">runc</a> to the new
          one based on <a class="printable" href="https://containerd.io">containerd</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my whole time at Pivotal, I've been heavily involved in the recruiting process, interviewing dozens of
          engineers for a range of engineering roles.

          users in 70 countries, where I was in charge of developing and maintaining one of the crucial components of
          their service-oriented architecture, built on PHP and MongoDB. I also developed a specialized Rails-based CMS
          which allows to quickly build digital content selling websites that use Onebip as their payment provider.
